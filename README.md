This project helps in removing noise. In this method, the noise spectrum is estimated during speech pauses, and is subtracted from the 
noisy speech spectrum to estimate the clean speech. This is also achieved by multiplying the noisy speech spectrum with a gain function 
and later combining it with the phase of the noisy speech.
